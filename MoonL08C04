# Connect to the  server at 'localhost', 10000 send any data,
# the server will respond with the required word codes
# You will find a passage of text in the file backdoor.txt write a script
# which will use that text to build a message using the received word codes.
# Each word code is sent on a new line and contains
# paragraph_number, line_number, word_number
# Send the expected words back to the server to retrieve the flag.
# The server expects all the words in a single transmission.
# The words should have punctuation stripped from them.
# And the words should be separated by newline characters (\\n)
