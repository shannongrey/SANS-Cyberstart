ForensicsL06C02: Missing Image

Here's another file we intercepted a while back. We know it contains a secret, and we're pretty sure it's an image file. But for some reason, it doesn't seem to be detected as one. She has probably made a change to it in some way and our analysts were never able to figure out what.

Tip: View the image to get the flag.

The image easter-island02.jpeg it said error, file type not detected. there seemed to be an issue opening the file due to formatting

Open image in Hex Editor to view formatting 
I did some research of what a jpeg header should look like

Change the first three bytes back to the correct header of “FF D8 FF” and saved into new image
Opened the file and zoomed into the image

Flag: H3ad3r$_4_W1nn3r$
