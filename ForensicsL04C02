Forensics L04C02: Hidden Hyena 

Our team in Kenya decided to take a page out of the hackers playbook and try sending an agent of their own along on one of the tours to follow a suspect they think might be one of the hackers. Our agent noticed them using a particular website which we believe had a secret message on it for him. Take a look at the network capture file and see if you can find anything interesting.

Tip: The flag is in the pcap.

The file included Tour Capture.pcapng is a pcap which insinuates Wireshark as the optimal tool
I noticed in the wording of the briefing "network capture" was used which lead me to believe a HTTP filter was used to read the data
I added "HTTP.Response" as the filter
From there two packets had "text/html" in their descriptions
After checking one and scrolling to the bottom of it's dataa I uncovered: <h1> Hello Again Agent</h1>\n. I tried to submit this as the flag but it didn't work.
I right clicked on the text, Follow --> TCP Stream
There was an odd Base64 string on top that I noticed due to the = at the end
I threw the string ZmxhZyBpcyBoZ2prczJKRnUhaGY= into Cyberchef

From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true,false)

flag is hgjks2JFu!hf
