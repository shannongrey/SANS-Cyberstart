ForensicsL06C04: Island Image

Here's a question for you, agent - one our team was never able to answer. We have a disk image file taken from the hacker which we know ran a number of oddly named executable files on the target machine, but we don't know what the names mean. Can you unravel the name of one of the programs?

Tip: One of the filenames (excluding its extension) contains the flag.

Export all the files using autopsy

The last section has 11 letters, while the rest have 10. I threw the last file name into Cyberchef and using Ceasier Cipher it produced: 

Flag: "PREFETCHWIN"
